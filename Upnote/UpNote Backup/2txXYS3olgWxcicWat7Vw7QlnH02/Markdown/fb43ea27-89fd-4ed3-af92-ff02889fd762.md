# 09 January

We had no attachments. We had our breakfast, relaxed ourselves. I went for shopping to Jaweri Baazar. Being weekend it was very much crowded. However, the market was very well organized as each shop had a number assigned to it. I bought a Sari. Our evening was again free. Since we did not have any attachment on next day as well we decided to take a detour and head towards Ranthambhor.

  

We reached Ranthambhor which is located in the Sawai Madhopur district. We stayed in the circuit house. The circuit house had wifi which was quite surprising !
