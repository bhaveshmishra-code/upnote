# 26 January

The republic day function was held at Mahua Tulaka in the district. Its a tribal area very near to the historic Bardoli. Our Bandhgala suit was put to use for the first time in last one month. We reached the venue at 9 am. Shri Mangubhai Patel the minister for forest and tribal development was the chief guest. The event was held at the sports ground of Uka Tarsadiya University which is a private institution. On the lighter note, it seemed that republic day was also on PPP basis !

  

The event began with the hoisting of the flag. Then the chief guest inspected the parade. This was followed by the address of the minister where he focussed on the various development schemes for tribal areas and their success stories. Then there were dance performances by school kids which included tribal dance, Bastar dance and dance on popular patriotic songs. We were mesmerized to see the acrobatic and dancing skills of the students. This was followed by the prize distribution ceremony. The function came to an end at 11 am. 

  

We headed back to the circuit house, had our lunch and watched the first T20 match between India and Australia. In the evening we went for shopping. Surat is a beautiful city and has big malls. 

  

In the evening the district administration again invited us for dinner at a 5 star hotel. We interacted with the IPS and IAS officers of 2009 batch who are currently posted as DDO and SP (Crime) in Surat.
