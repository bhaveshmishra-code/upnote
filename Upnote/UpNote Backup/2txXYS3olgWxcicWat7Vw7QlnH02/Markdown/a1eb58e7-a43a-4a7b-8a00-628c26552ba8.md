_A man went to a bar._Â   
  
  
_He orders nine shots._  
_The bartender apprehensive asks, "whats the occasion?"_  
_The man mumbles, "first blowjob."_  
_The bartender brightens up and pours nine shots and lays them out._  
_The man downs all nine in a row._  
_The bartender still smiling says,_  
_"hey, make it an even ten. On the house."_  
_The man shakes his head,_  
_"_**_No thanks. If the first nine didn't wash out the taste, I doubt one more would help."_**
