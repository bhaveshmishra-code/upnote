A boy had a crush on a girl  
  
He followed her wherever she went.   
One day the girl noticed and asked the guy.   
Girl: Why do you keep following me?   
Boy: Because you're soo pretty and I think I'm  falling in love with you.   
Girl: Really? But you haven't met my friend yet. She is prettier than me and she is right behind you.   
               ( The boy turns around )         
  
Boy: Are you making fun of me? There's no one behind me. 

Girl: No, but if you really loved, me you don't even bother to look back.
