# 08 January

We reached Jaipur early in the morning.

We were put up at Circuit house.

In the morning we had an attachment with Jaipur foot.

- Started in 1975 by D.K Gupta
- One of best innovations in 20th century.
- Free service to every person
- Within 2-3 days.
- Funded through donations. Since it gives free service therefore is able to attract donations. Earlier it was criticised for its revenue model but it proved its critics wrong by being successful for last 40 years.
- Visited State of the Art centre for studying body motion and incorporating the data into next set of design.
- The cost is around 3000
- We met with a citizen of Kosovo and Jaipur foot helped him.
- Jaipur foot also runs library for poor school children.

  

We then had a lunch and spent our evening watching Star Wars movie.
