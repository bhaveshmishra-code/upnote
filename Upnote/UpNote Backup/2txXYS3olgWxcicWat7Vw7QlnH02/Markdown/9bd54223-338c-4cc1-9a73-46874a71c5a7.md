# Show Cause Notice - Athletic Meet Absence

Respected Madam,

  

I, Bhavesh Mishra (B 82), have been issued a show cause notice regarding absence from athletic meet on 31st October 2015. On that day I missed the last attendance that was taken at 3 PM. I have no genuine reason for my absence except that I had ventured out of Polo Ground and felt asleep in my room. This is a silly reason and I must have informed the academy before leaving the ground.Â 

  

Madam, in the last 2 months this is for the very first time that I have shown such negligence and I am very sorry for this. I promise not to repeat such mistakes again.

  

Thanking You

  

Yours Sincerely

Bhavesh Mishra (B 82)
