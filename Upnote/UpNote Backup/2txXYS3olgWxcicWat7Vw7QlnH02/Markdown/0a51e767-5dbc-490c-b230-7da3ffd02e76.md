Son: "Daddy, I fell in love & want to date this awesome girl!"  
Father: "That's great son. Who is she?"  
Son: "It's Sandra, the neighbor's daughter".  
Father: "Oh hoo, I wish you hadn't said that.  
I have to tell you something son, but you must  
promise not to tell your mother.  
Sandra is actually your sister."  
  
The boy is naturally bummed out, but a couple of months later  
Son: "Daddy, I fell in love again and she is even  
hotter!"  
Father: "That's great son. Who is she?"  
Son: "It's Angela, the other neighbor's daughter."  
Father: "Oh ho, I wish you hadn't said that.  
Angela is also your sister."   
This went on couple of times and the son was so  
mad,  
he went straight to his mother crying.  
Son: "Mum I am so mad at dad! I fell in love with  
six girls but I can't date any of them because daddy is their father!"  
The mother hugs him affectionately and says:  
"My love, you can date whoever you want.  
Don't listen to him. He is not your Father."!!!

Son  Fainted... :p
