# 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership

## 1 - Law of the Lid

The lower an individualâ€™s ability to lead, the lower the lid on his potential. The higher the leadership, the greater the effectiveness.

Personal success without leadership ability brings only limited effectiveness.

The higher you want to climb, the more you need leadership.

  

**Leadership has a multiplying effect.**

To change the effectiveness of the team, lift up the leadership of the coach.

  

## 2 - Law of Influence

### The management myth

Leadership is about influencing people to follow, while management focusses on maintaining systems and processes.

Managers can maintain direction but never change it. To move people in new direction, you need influence.

  

### The entrepreneur myth

  

### The knowledge myth

  

### The pioneer myth

To be a leader, the person has to not only be out front, but also have people intentionally coming behind him.

  

### The position myth

  

**The very essence of all power to influence lies in getting the other person to participate.**

**Leadership is influence - Nothing Else Nothing More**

## **3 - The law of process**

**The secret of our success is found in our daily agenda.**

**It is the capacity to develop and improve their skills that distinguishes leaders from their followers.**

The goal each day must be to get better, to build on previous day's progress.

  

**To lead tomorrow, learn today**
