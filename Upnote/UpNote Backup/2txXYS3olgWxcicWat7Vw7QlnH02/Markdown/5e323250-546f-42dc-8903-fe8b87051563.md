# 17 January

It was our last day in Udaipur. I continued the practice of taking a walk around Fateh Sagar Lake. We were free for the day. We boarded the bus for Ahmedabad at 2 pm. We thanked our protocol officer for being so cordial and cooperative. The speed of the bus frustrated us as it kept moving at a speed of 40 - 50 km per hour. Upon entering Gujarat we had to convince RTO not to levy entry tax on us. The process took more than half an hour. After a while all of us got hungry and therefore stopped the bus at a roadside hotel. We had some light snacks.

It was then time for some fun and entertainment. We played some peppy songs on speaker and danced to the tunes. We were quite conscious of the onlookers.

We reached Ahmedabad at around 8:30 pm. We were really impressed by the wide roads and impressive infrastructure of the Gandhinagar city. Our stay was in the very comfortable Holiday Inn hotel located in the heart of the city. After a long tiring 6 hours of bus ride it was time to doze off.
