# Hostel TC 13-05-2023 

1. There should not be any mismatch between the number of students present in the hostel and the number of students for which the food bills are claimed.
2. The menu decided by the Government should be followed at every time of the meal. 
3. The food should be prepared in a safe environment and it should be ensured that food is cooked in a place which is free from rodents, insects etc. 
4. Similarly, all food items like rice, wheat flour, condiments, sugar and other food related items should be stored safely.
5. There have been reports in the media in the past that rice meant for hostels were sent to outside. Such malpractices should be strictly avoided.
6. The quantity of the food prepared should be in accordance with the number of students present in the hostel on that particular today. It has been found that many students are forced to complete their food with less quantity of curry or daal. 
7. Further, the quality of the food should be as per the standards. Incidents like daal having excess water, poor quality rice etc should be strictly avoided.
