_Rhonda went to a pet shop and immediately spotted a large beautiful parrot.   There was a sign on the cage that said $50.00.   "Why so little?"   she asked the pet store owner._  
_The owner replied,   "Look,   I should tell you first that this bird used to live in a house of prostitution,   and sometimes it says some pretty vulgar stuff."_

_The woman thought about this,   but decided she had to have the bird anyway.   She took it home and hung the bird's cage up in her living room and waited for it to say something.   The bird looked around the room,   then at her,   and said,   "New house,   new madam."   The woman was a bit shocked at the implication,   but then thought,   "That's not so bad."   When her two teenage daughters returned from school the bird saw them and said,   "New house,   new madam,   new girls."   The girls and the woman were a bit offended but then began to laugh about the situation.   Moments later,   the woman's husband,   Robert,   came home from work.   The bird looked at him and said,   "Hi Robert."_
