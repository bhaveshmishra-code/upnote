# 18 February

Today was the last day of our Bharat Darshan. Since our flight was scheduled in the evening our whole day was free. We decided to watch a movie at the nearby mall.

  

After the movie it was time to pack our bags for the final time. It's amazing how two months passed away in a jiffy. We reached airport and found that there were other 2 groups who were in the same Indigo flight.

  

It was nice meeting our batch mates after 2 months. There was laughter and chit chatting throughout the duration of our flight.

  

We reached Delhi at 9:30 from where we came to Janpath hotel. We thanked and congratulated each other for such a wonderful Bharat Darshan.

  

During our WST we came across a line in a local hindi newspaper and that has literally become the tag line for our group. The line goes like:

  

No Wonder, It's so rare !

  

So whenever we see a novel thing or experience something new we unfailingly have somebody mentioning this line.
