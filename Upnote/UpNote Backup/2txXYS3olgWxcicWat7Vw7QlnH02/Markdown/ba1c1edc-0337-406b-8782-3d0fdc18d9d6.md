A lovely little girl was holding two apples with both hands.  
Her mum came in and softly asked her little  daughter with a smile: my sweetie, could you give your mum one of your two apples?  
The girl looked up at her mum for some seconds, then she suddenly took a quick bite on one apple, and then quickly on the other.  
The mum felt the smile on her face freeze. She tried hard not to reveal her disappointment.  
Then the little girl handed one of her bitten apples to her mum,and said: mummy, here you are. This is the sweeter one.  
  

No matter who you are, how experienced you are, and how knowledgeable you think you are, always delay judgement.  Give others the privelege to explain themselves. What you see may not be the reality. Never conclude for others.
