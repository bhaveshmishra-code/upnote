# Ice and Boys

[https://www.quora.com/](https://www.quora.com/)

Once upon a time, two young boys were playing on thin ice. As they were playing, one of them fell through that ice into the lake underneath. The other one tried hard and he couldn't reach his friend through that gap.  
  
So he walked up to a tree, pulled and broke a branch of enormous size. He came back and started beating the ice and he saved his friend.  
  
When the paramedics came and they were able to revive the kid, they were baffled and they couldn't understand that how did his friend break an enormous sized branch and then beat the ice and save his friend. They thought it wasÂ **IMPOSSIBLE**  
  
Then the old man who was standing there said, "I can tell you how he did it."  
  
They said, "How? How he did it."  
  
The old man said, "**There was no one here to tell him that he can't do it.".**
