# **Crime and Civil Wrong**

  

Wrongs include wrong declared by law as well as rights infringed. An act or omission which is not a wrong may be made so by the law.

  

In case of conspiracy mere intention is enough for crime.

  

A civil wrong is an infringement of the legal right of an individual (group / association) which does not affect the society in general and is redressable by monetary compensation.

  

The distinction between civil and criminal wrongs depends on the nature of the remedy provided by the law. A civil proceedings concerns with the enforcement of some right claimed by the plaintiff as against the defendant whereas criminal proceedings have for their object the punishment of the accused for some act of which he is accused.

  

Civil cases are compromisable where criminal cases are generally not. In case of non-compoundable offence a compromise between the accused and the individual victim is illegal.

  

In cognizable offence, the state is party in all cases. FIR is mandatory

# **Administration of Justice**

  

Means exercise of judicial power to maintain / uphold rights and punish wrongs.

- Civil Justice : concerned with enforcement of rights. Redress in civil cases = compensation
- Criminal Justice : aims at punishment of the offenders. Redress = no relief to the victim. punishment to criminal.

  

**Principles**

- 100 guilty persons can be let free but no innocent shall be punished.
- The accused is presumed to be innocent till the guilt is proved.
- The burden of the proof is on the prosecution
- The accused must be given a Benefit of Doubt.
- Civil Cases = preponderance of probabilities. Criminal = prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt
- Punishment shall reform the offender

# **Legal Right / Duty**

  

**Legal Right**

Every legal right has 5 characteristics:

1. A person of inherence: Owner of the right / entitled to rights. The owner may be a person, indeterminate body (society)
2. A person of incidence: Operates against some person who is under a duty to obey or respect that right.
3. An obligation to do or not to do something: The content of the legal right may be an ACT or an OMISSION Right to receive goods.
4. Object of the right: The right must relate to something e.g tangible (right to property) and intangible (right to good will)
5. Title: Title signifies the source of the legal right i.e how the owner of the right became the owner e.g Citizenship, FR, Inheritance

**Duty**

1. Obligatory act. It is an act opposite of which would be wrong. Duties and wrongs are correlatives.
2. Positive duty and negative duty. When the law obliges us to do the act then it is a positive duty and when forbears from doing an act the duty is negative.
3. Primary & Secondary Duty : exist per se indpendent of any other duty e.g forbear from causing harm. A secondary duty has no independent existence but exists for enforcement of other duties e.g duty to pay a man damages for the injury (remedial duty)
4. Absolute and Relative Duties: Owed only to the State, breach is a crime and remedy is punishment. Relative owed to a person. Breach is a civil injury and remedy is compensation.

  

**Types of Rights**

1. Positive & Negative
- Corresponds to positive duty. Scope is to receive positive benefit. Similarly negative right corresponds to negative duty.
- In any society the number of negative rights are more than positive rights.

3. Proprietary & Personal
- Proprietary means a person's right in relation to his own property, estate or assets.
- Personal is right in relation to a person's status e.g right to reputation, freedom of speech. Corresponding to personal right is a personal duty.
- Prop rights can be valued in terms of money and personal cannot.

5. Inheritable & Uninheritable
- Prop rights are inheritable
- Personal rights are uniheritable. They extinguish with the death of the owner of the right.

7. Rights in _rem_ and Rights in _personam_
- _Rem_ available against the whole world e.g Right to my money
- _Personam_ available against a particular person (group of person). Arises due to contract
- Rights in _personam_ are positive in nature.

9. Principal & Accessory
- Principal is the main right vested in a person.
- Accessory is the secondary, subordinate right which arises out of principal right e.g The right of landlord to the land owned is a principal right whereas the right to enjoy rents is an accessory right.

11. General Rights & Special Rights
- Propounded by H.L.A Hart in 1955. General rights are possessed by all members of society e.g the right to vote in election.
- Special rights arise out of special transaction between specific individuals from special relationship e.g contract, the right to withdraw money from bank
