# 10 January

We headed for Ranthambhore tiger reserve in the morning. We were in a open jeep. The place was quite crowded with hundreds of tourists eager to catch a glimpse of the tiger. The place is absolutely beautiful and is surrounded by mighty forts. As luck would have it we were able to spot a tiger within an hour. It was the closest one could come to a tiger. For a moment we were all frightened by it but I guess the tiger has also become used to the limelight and camera flashes! Like a fashion model it posed for us and then got lost in the jungle.

  

There were very cute birds on the way and if you hold some eatables like biscuits in your hand then the birds come, sit on your palm and eat! The experience was simply amazing.

  

After the visit we relished the local morning breakfast of Kachori, Daal and Tea and then headed back to Jaipur. Ranthambhore is very famous for its delicious guavas. We bought few kilos of these.
