**Gandhi and Martin Luther**

Gandhiji was the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of non violent mass resistance presenting it as alternative to war and violence. He tranformed the nature of politics from being an elite based into a social change through mass participation. 

Gandhi and King were born so much apart in space and time but yet their philosophies converged in making non violence a potent tool.

Gandhiji led a majority (Indians) against minority (British). King led minority (blacks) against majority(whites). 

King said in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech - _"nonviolence is not servile passivity but a powerful moral force which makes for social transformation"_

  

**Bertrand Russell**

Humanism. We human being have complete autonomy to decide our lives.

Unless we take the rein of life in our own hand there will not be any meaningful life. In the name of morality many immoral acts are also perpetrated. We need to stand up against such injustice for achievement of a higher universal goal.

**Bhagwad Gita**

Literally it means God's song i.e discourse of Lord Krishna to persuade the reluctant Arjun to perform his swadharma. It's contained in the Bheesma parva of Mahabharat. It represents a unique synthesis of action, devotion and knowledge. It teaches the path of action (Karma yoga), path of Knowledge (Gyana yoga), path of devotion (Bhakti Yoga). These three paths are the means to realise the highest ideals of life. The literal meaning of yoga is union i.e union of individual with the ideal and excellence of action which comes through detachment. An ideal yogi is one who is able to regulate passions and remains calm in pleasant as well as adverse conditions. One is like a flame which doesn't flicker in a windless condition since one is unaffected by joys and sorrows.

  

Nishkama Karma

1. Disinterested action, detached spirit.
2. It teaches renunciation in action and not renunciation of action i.e it is not the action that is to be given up but self interest and attachment. Geeta equates inaction to death. Life depends upon action.
3. Actions are within our purview while results are beyond us. We are under moral obligations to perform our duties without any consideration of success or failure.

**David Hume**

He gave the concept of ethical Hedonism. Pleasure ought to be sought because this is how we are naturally constituted.

Pleasure of Inidividual is called Egoism whereas pleasure of everyone is altruism or universalism.

**Gautam Buddha**

Astangika Marga

  

**Immanuel Kant**

Every human being is to be equally valued.

He propagated Autonomy of Ethics. According to this even God has to be moral. In other words the moral laws exist independently of God just as the laws of mathematics and logic. Even if there is no God nothing is changed i.e. if we choose to be moral we have the same duties whether we are theists or atheists.

Only basis of ethics is reason and rationality.

There can be autonomous sphere of investigation to decide what is wrong and what is right. Why can't ethics and morality have a universal application.

His ethics is deontological i.e. duty is to be performed for the sake of duty alone without regard for the consequences. Morality must be based solely on the reason. Reason has a practical component which guides us in formulating principle of action. He called it practical reason. He maintains that morality is not confined within cultural boundaries and it doesn't deped on emotions, feelings or desire.

  

According to Kant agent shall have highest regard for duty or law but duty or law must not be imposed by external authorities. Action has no moral significance if it is based on external law. We act morally only when we act in accordance with law that we freely accept and impose on ourselves.

  

But the question is how do we frame such laws?

Kant says through the principle of universalizability. A law must be universal and applicable in all cases without any exception like the laws of nature (universal, unconditional, without discretion). A subjective principle of action can become a law if the agent grants that everyone under the given circumstances should be doing the same. For instance, breaking a promise can never become a duty because it can't be universalized. Similarly suicide is wrong because it can't become a universal law.

  

Kant regards moral law as Categorical Imperative. It must be obeyed without any exception. It acts as an imperative because we are partly rational. Performance of duty is not a part of our nature.

  

He distinguishes between categorical imperative and hypothetical imperative. Hypothetical imperative is conditioned by some purpose or end. It has if then structure. It has nothing to do with morality. Categorical imperative on the other hand asks us to do our duty for the sake of duty alone. There's no further end to be realised.

  

According to Kant human beings are end in themselves and not means. Kant envisages kingdom of ends as an ideal society in which every person would act in a rational way, follow the categorical imperative and thereby live in a perfect harmony with the nature.

  

Always focused on his work and strictly following his daily routines, Kant lived a highly disciplined life. He got up at 4:45 a.m. every morning and went to bed at 10 p.m. The citizens of Königsberg are said to have set their watches by the regular time he passed their doors on his daily walk after lunch. However rigid Kant seems to have been in his work, contemporaries also praised his dry humor and his sociability. He regularly entertained guests for lunch or dinner.  

    Kant retired from teaching in 1796. He died in 1804, shortly before his eightieth birthday. His tombstone near the cathedral of Kaliningrad  contains what is perhaps the single most famous passage of his work (from the end of his _Critique of Practical Reason_): “Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often and steadily we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.

  

There is nothing higher than reason.

  

Live your life as though your every act were to become a universal law.

  

If man makes himself a worm he must not complain when he is trodden on.

  

**Kautilya**

Arthashastra -> It is a text on statecraft.

If there is no state then there will be complete anarchy and the justice of fishworld (matsyanyaya) will prevail. According to him, it is the duty of the state to maintain moral order in the state.

  

**Mahatma Gandhi**

His view of Sarvodaya Samaj.

Gandhi transformed the nature of politics from being an elite-based vanity into a ‘soul force’ for social change through mass participation. His broad-basing of India’s national movement transformed the Congress party from being a talking-shop for airing grievances into a mass-based organisation defying the British Empire.

  

**Mahavira**

Triratna.

  

**Plato**

He wrote Republic and Euthyphro.

His ideal republic in which he has explained the concept of justice.

He examines whether it is in one's own interest to be moral. He establishes that justice is so great a good that it is worth any sacrifice.

His opponents argue that given a chance everyone would like to become immoral but because of the fear of punishment people behave in a moral way. However, such a world be full of chaos and conflict and would make life difficult. To resolve this conflict, people have compromised and the result of that compromise is justice.

  

Gyges Ring

A shephard named Gyges gets a ring that makes him invisible. He uses the ring to fulfill all his greed with impunity.

  

Justice is not only a means of happiness but essential to it. Justice brings about a healthy soul whereas immorality corrupts the soul. It weakens the soul and makes it a slave of desires and passions. A moral person is able to tame the beasts of desire and passions and thereby acquires justice. One is happy or unhappy in exact proportion to once moral integrity.

  

Sisyphus was condemned by the God to push a heavy stone along a steep slope. This represents a life of futility.

  

Morality is important for a meaningful life. It urges us to discover values and ideals, such as justice, truth, god, beauty, virtue and so on pursuing which we will be able ot live a life of meaning, substance and contentment.

  

Good of an individual is contained in the Good of all.

There is a highest purpose and every component of world is trying to realise it.

  

**Nietzche**

Morality is required for a life of integrity. It is the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles.

It has 2 dimensions:

1. Internal: A state of completeness and wholeness. It involves a vision of ideal self (who one ought to be). It is attained when an individual is able to realise one's ideal self.
2. External: It is a state where life is lived in accordance with external ethical norms or pinciples/guidelines.

**Tolstoy**

He believed that any valid morality will happen only when it is rooted in religion. Flower and Root concept. Flower is compared to Ethics. If we pluck a flower it will not survive for long.

## Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832)

He argued against "natural law" theory and thought that the classical theories of Plato and Aristotle as well as notions such as Kant's Categorical Imperative were too outdated, confusing and/or controversial to be of much help with society's ills and a program of social reform. He adopted what he took to be a simple and 'scientific' approach to the problems of law and morality and grounded his approach in the "Principle of Utility."

The Utilitarian Calculus

As with the emerging theory of capitalism in 18th and 19th Century England, we could speak of "pleasures" as "PLUSES" and "pains" as "MINUSES." Thus the utilitarian would calculate which actions bring about more pluses over minuses (or the least amount of minuses, etc.).

In measuring pleasure and pain, Bentham introduces the following criteria:

Its INTENSITY, DURATION, CERTAINTY (or UNCERTAINTY), and its NEARNESS (or FARNESS). He also includes its "fecundity" (more or less of the same will follow) and its "purity" (its pleasure won't be followed by pain & vice versa).

In considering actions that affect numbers of people, we must also account for their EXTENT.

As a social reformer, Bentham applied this principle to the laws of England -- for example, those areas of the law concerning crime and punishment. An analysis of theft reveals that it not only causes harm to the victim, but, if left unpunished, it endangers the very status of private property and the stability of society. In seeing this, the legislator should devise a punishment that is useful in deterring theft. But in matters of "private morality" such as sexual preference and private behavior, Bentham felt that is was not at all useful to involve the legislature.

Bentham also thought that the principle of utility could apply to our treatment of animals. The question is not whether they can talk or reason, but whether they can suffer. As such, that suffering should be taken into account in our treatment of them. Here we can see a moral ground for laws that aim at the "prevention of cruelty to animals" (and such cruelty was often witnessed in Bentham's day).

### John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)

It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied, better Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.

For Mill, it is not the quantity of pleasure, but the quality of happiness. Bentham's calculus is unreasonable -- qualities cannot be quantified (there is a distinction between 'higher' and 'lower' pleasures). Mill's utilitarianism culminates in "The Greatest Happiness Principle."

Excerpts from Mill's Utilitarianism (1861):

If I am asked what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures, or what makes one pleasure more valuable than another, merely as a pleasure, except its being greater in amount, there is but one possible answer. Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure.

Now it is an unquestionable fact that those who are equally acquainted with and equally capable of appreciating and enjoying both do give a most marked preference to the manner of existence which employs their higher faculties. Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being would consent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base, even though they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs. One can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence. 

## Thomas Hobbes (1588 - 1679)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| <br> | What 'moves us' are desires and aversions and the force behind these is self-preservation<br><br>Self-interest prescribes that we avoid the 'beastly, brutal, and short' state of nature and seek a peaceful co-existence<br><br>'Peace' is achieved when we transfer our collective strength to a sovereign authority (a Leviathan)<br><br>The social contract with the Leviathan forms the source of right and wrong (through the will of the Leviathan) |

Thomas Hobbes was the first great figure in modern moral philosophy. His main grounding in philosophy was on the basis of materialism, believing that everything that happens is a result of the physical world and that the soul, as previous philosophers discussed it, does not exist. One must then consider what Hobbes' outlook was on the topic of values. Hobbes' contention was that the concept of good and evil are related to human desire and aversion. In other words, what an individual desires he percieves to be good and what that individual harbors an aversion to must be bad. This philosophy of values, Hobbes explained, is due to an attitude of self preservation and protection.

In 1651 Thomas Hobbes published _Leviathan_ , his famous work that detailed his physicalist outlook and his concept of the value of a social contract for a peaceful society. Hobbes explained that if individuals within a society continally lived by their own self interests, they would continue to hurt each other and be stuck in a "state of war." If the members of a society were made to live within certain bounds which made it impossible for them to harm each other, the members of that society would be in a "state of peace."

The only way to acheive this peaceful society, Hobbes explained, was for all members of a society to unconditionally transfer all of their ability and will to defend themselves to a sovereign power under a form of social contract. With this social contract established, the sovereign power would accept the responsibility for mediating all disputes concerning the society, both internal and external. Should any member of the society violate an agreement with another member of that society, that individual would be guilty of violating their unconditional agreement to support the social contract, which would then render them unjust and subject to punishment.

Conversely, if the Leviathan, or sovereign power, violated its own responsibility to protect the members of the society in its charge, that society could then find itself another sovereign to rule it.

# Virtue ethics  
Virtue ethics is person rather than action based. It looks at the moral character of the person carrying out an action rather than at ethical duties and rules, or the consequences of particular actions. According to it a right act is the action a virtuous person would do in the same circumstances.

# Virtue ethics not only deals with the rightness or wrongness of individual actions, it provides guidance as to the sort of characteristics and behaviours a good person will seek to achieve. In that way, virtue ethics is concerned with the whole of a person's life, rather than particular episodes or actions. A good person is someone who lives virtuously - who possesses and lives the virtues.  
  
It's a useful theory since human beings are often more interested in assessing the character of another person than they are in assessing the goodness or badness of a particular action. This suggests that the way to build a good society is to help its members to be good people, rather than to use laws and punishments to prevent or deter bad actions.

# But it wouldn't be helpful if a person had to be a saint to count as virtuous. For virtue theory to be really useful it needs to suggest only a minimum set of characteristics that a person needs to possess in order to be regarded as virtuous.  
...being virtuous is more than having a particular habit of acting, e.g. generosity. Rather, it means having a fundamental set of related virtues that enable a person to live and act morally well.  
  

# PrinciplesVirtue ethics teaches:       An action is only right if it is an action that a virtuous person would carry out in the same circumstances.       A virtuous person is a person who acts virtuously       A person acts virtuously if they "possess and live the virtues"       A virtue is a moral characteristic that a person needs to live well.  
  
  
  
Most virtue theorists say that there is a common set of virtues that all human beings would benefit from, rather than different sets for different sorts of people, and that these virtues are natural to mature human beings - even if they are hard to acquire.  
This poses a problem, since lists of virtues from different times in history and different societies show significant differences.  
The traditional list of cardinal virtues was:       Prudence       Justice       Fortitude / Bravery       Temperance  
  
Good points of virtue ethics

1. It centres ethics on the person and what it means to be human
2. It includes the whole of a person's life

Bad points of virtue ethics  
  

# It doesn't provide clear guidance on what to do in moral dilemmas although it does provide general guidance on how to be a good person presumably a totally virtuous person would know what to do and we could consider them a suitable role model to guide us

# There is no general agreement on what the virtues are and it may be that any list of virtues will be relative to the culture in which it is being drawn up.Search term:

In an article entitled "On a Supposed Right to Lie from Altruistic Motives," Kant interprets a case of 'the Murderer at the Inn.' Imagine that you are an Inn keeper and a terrified man runs past you and up the stairs. Shortly thereafter, a brute appears and -- clearly angry and looking for blood -- asks you if that man is in your dwelling. What should you do, tell the truth (and reveal that the man is upstairs) or tell a lie (and perhaps save that man's life)? Kant responded as follows:

> "For instance, if by telling a lie you have prevented murder, you have made yourself legally responsible for all the consequences; but if you have held rigorously to the truth, public justice can lay no hand on you, whatever the unforeseen consequences may be. After you have honestly answered the murderer's question as to whether this intended victim is at home, it may be that he has slipped out so that he does not come in the way of the murderer, and thus that the murder may not be committed. But if you had lied and said he was not at home when he had really gone out without your knowing it, and if the murderer had then met him as he went away and murdered him, you might be justly accused as the cause of his death. For if you had told the truth as far as you knew it, perhaps the murderer might have been apprehended by the neighbors while he searched the house and thus the deed might have been prevented. Therefore, whoever tells a lie, however well intentioned he might be, must answer for the consequences, however unforeseeable they were, and pay the penalty for them even in a civil tribunal. This is because truthfulness is a duty which must be regarded as the ground of all duties based on contract, and the laws of these duties would be rendered uncertain and useless if even the least exception to them were admitted. To be truthful (honest) in all declarations, therefore, is a sacred and absolutely commanding decree of reason, limited by no expediency."

In taking this 'absolutist' stand, Kant was following in a tradition represented by, for example, St. Augustine in his work _The Enchiridion_

> "But every liar says the opposite of what he thinks in his heart, with purpose to deceive. Now it is evident that speech was given to man, not that men might therewith deceive one another, but that one man might make known his thoughts to another. To use speech, then, for the purpose of deception, and not for its appointed end, is a sin. Nor are we to suppose that there is any lie that is not a sin, because it is sometimes possible, by telling a lie, to do service to another."

# Duty-based ethics

The word 'deontological' comes from the Greek word _deon_, which means 'duty'. Deontological (duty-based) ethics are concerned with what people do, not with the consequences of their actions.

## Duty-based or Deontological ethics

Deontological (duty-based) ethics are concerned with what people do, not with the consequences of their actions.

1. Do the right things because it's the right thing to do.
2. Don't do wrong things and avoid them because they are wrong.

Under this form of ethics you can't justify an action by showing that it produced good consequences, which is why it's sometimes called 'non-Consequentialist'.

  

Some kinds of action are wrong or right in themselves, regardless of the consequences.

Deontologists live in a universe of moral rules, such as:

1. It is wrong to kill innocent people
2. It is wrong to steal
3. It is wrong to tell lies
4. It is right to keep promises

Someone who follows Duty-based ethics should do the right thing, even if that produces more harm (or less good) than doing the wrong thing. So, for example, the philosopher Kant thought that it would be wrong to tell a lie in order to save a friend from a murderer.

If we compare Deontologists with Consequentialists we can see that Consequentialists begin by considering what things are good, and identify 'right' actions as the ones that produce the maximum of those good things.

Deontologists appear to do it the other way around; they first consider what actions are 'right' and proceed from there. (Actually this is what they do in practice, but it isn't really the starting point of deontological thinking.)

So a person is doing something good if they are doing a morally right action.

## Good and bad points

### Good points of duty-based ethics

- emphasises the value of every human being
    - Duty-based ethical systems tend to focus on giving equal respect to all human beings.
    - This provides a basis for human rights - it forces due regard to be given to the interests of a single person even when those are at odds with the interests of a larger group.
- says some acts are always wrong
    - Kantian duty-based ethics says that some things should never be done, no matter what good consequences they produce. This seems to reflect the way some human beings think.
    - Rossian duty-based ethics modified this to allow various duties to be balanced, which, it could be argued, is an even better fit to the way we think.
- provides 'certainty'
    - Consequentialist ethical theories bring a degree of uncertainty to ethical decision-making, in that no-one can be certain about what consequences will result from a particular action, because the future is unpredictable.
    - Duty-based ethics don't suffer from this problem because they are concerned with the action itself - if an action is a right action, then a person should do it, if it's a wrong action they shouldn't do it - and providing there is a clear set of moral rules to follow then a person faced with a moral choice should be able to take decisions with reasonable certainty.
    - Of course things aren't that clear cut. Sometimes consequentialist theories can provide a fair degree of certainty, if the consequences are easily predictable.
    - Furthermore, rule-based consequentialism provides people with a set of rules that enable them to take moral decisions based on the sort of act they are contemplating.
- deals with intentions and motives
    - Consequentialist theories don't pay direct attention to whether an act is carried out with good or bad intentions; most people think these are highly relevant to moral judgements.
    - Duty-based ethics can include intention in at least 2 ways...
    - If a person didn't intend to do a particular wrong act - it was an accident perhaps - then from a deontological point of view we might think that they hadn't done anything deserving of criticism. This seems to fit with ordinary thinking about ethical issues.
    - Ethical rules can be framed narrowly so as to include intention.

### Bad points of duty-based ethics

- absolutist
    - Duty-based ethics sets absolute rules. The only way of dealing with cases that don't seem to fit is to build a list of exceptions to the rule.
- allows acts that make the world a less good place
    - Because duty-based ethics is not interested in the results it can lead to courses of action that produce a reduction in the overall happiness of the world.
    - Most people would find this didn't fit with their overall idea of ethics:

> ...it is hard to believe that it could ever be a duty deliberately to produce less good when we could produce more...

- hard to reconcile conflicting duties
    - Duty-based ethics doesn't deal well with the cases where duties are in conflict.

## Kantian duty-based ethics

Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was arguably one of the greatest philosophers of all time. Kant thought that it was possible to develop a consistent moral system by using reason. Kant taught, they would realise that there were some moral laws that all rational beings had to obey simply because they were rational beings, and this would apply to any rational beings in any universe that might ever exist.

  

Kant taught (rather optimistically) that every rational human being could work this out for themselves and so did not need to depend on God or their community or anything else to discover what was right and what was wrong. Nor did they need to look at the consequences of an act, or who was doing the action.

Although Kantian ethics are usually spoken of in terms of duty and doing the right thing, Kant himself thought that what was good was an essential part of ethics.

Kant asked if there was anything that everybody could rationally agree was always good. The only thing that he thought satisfied this test was a good will:

All Kant means is that a good will alone must be good in whatever context it may be found. It is not good in one context and bad in another. It is not good as a means to one end and bad as a means to another. Its goodness is not conditioned by its relation to a context or to an end or to a desire.

Other things that we might think of as good are not always good, as it's possible to imagine a context in which they might seem to be morally undesirable.

Kant then pondered what this meant for human conduct. He concluded that only an action done for 'a good will' was a right action, regardless of the consequences.

Kant taught that an action could only count as the action of a good will if it satisfied the test of the Categorical Imperative.

## Kant's version of duty-based ethics was based on something that he called 'the categorical imperative' which he intended to be the basis of all other rules (a 'categorical imperative' is a rule that is true in all circumstances.)

The categorical imperative comes in two versions which each emphasise different aspects of the categorical imperative. Kant is clear that each of these versions is merely a different way of expressing the same rule; they are not different rules.

### Moral rules must be universalisable

The first one emphasises the need for moral rules to be universalisable. Always act in such a way that you can also will that the maxim of your action should become a universal law.

To put this more simply: Always act in such a way that you would be willing for it to become a general law that everyone else should do the same in the same situation.

This means at least two things:

1. If you aren't willing for the ethical rule you claim to be following to be applied equally to everyone - including you - then that rule is not a valid moral rule. I can't claim that something is a valid moral rule and make an exception to it for myself and my family and friends.

So, for example, if I wonder whether I should break a promise, I can test whether this is right by asking myself whether I would want there to be a universal rule that says 'it's OK to break promises'. Since I don't want there to be a rule that lets people break promises _they_ make to _me_, I can conclude that it would be wrong for me to break the promise I have made. If the ethical rule you claim to be following cannot logically be made a universal rule, then it is not a valid moral rule.

**Moral rules must respect human beings**

Kant thought that all human beings should be treated as free and equal members of a shared moral community, and the second version of the categorical imperative reflects this by emphasising the importance of treating people properly. It also acknowledges the relevance of intention in morality.

1. Act so that you treat humanity always as an end and never merely as a means.
2. Man and, in general, every rational being exists as an end in himself and not merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or that will. In all his actions, whether they are directed to himself or to other rational beings, he must always be regarded at the same time as an end...

Kant is saying that people should always be treated as valuable - as an end in themselves - and should not just be used in order to achieve something else. They should not be tricked, manipulated or bullied into doing things.

Here are three examples of treating people as means and not ends:

1. treating a person as if they were an inanimate object
2. coercing a person to get what you want
3. deceiving a person to get what you want

Kant doesn't want to say that people can't be used at all; it may be fine to use a person as long as they are also being treated as an end in themselves.

### The importance of duty

1. Do the right thing for the right reason, because it is the right thing to do.
2. Kant thought that the only good reason for doing the right thing was because of duty - if you had some other reason (perhaps you didn't commit murder because you were too scared, not because it was your duty not to) then that you would not have acted in a morally good way.

Interpretation of religion should not be seen as final. It should be contextual and in sync with the time in which we are living. There are myriads of condition and situation which can't be addressed by mere subjective reading of text. 

  

Mind is the charioteer and senses are horses.

  

Life of integrity is restrained and controlled.

  

The Origin of Humanism  
  

The Prayer "Sarvatra Sukhinah Santu Sarve Santu Niramayah;" \`Let all be happy here and let all enjoy full health’ of Vedic Sages echoed this Universal welfare. The earthly life constitutes the central concern for the Vedic Aryans. The sacrificial fire-rites which were evolved during Vedic period had social welfare as its motto, the motive was to prepare the land for agriculture for abundance and welfare of human race.  
Vedantic Hinduism of Vivekananda stresess the importance of service to the weak and the needy as its practical aspect.

  
Various Interpretations of Humanism  
Humanism is not an established school of philosophy, but is a definite philosophical outlook. It emphasized the worth and dignity of man by rejecting other worldliness and transcendentalism. It is this worldly, man-centered secular philosophical outlook. It claims that the man is self-sufficient and is able to comprehend the world phenomena and works out a certain social order without the help of God. It is an attitude towards and an approach to man's worldly life and values. It is characterised by interest in man, concern for man and faith in man's reason and conscience for discriminating perception of truth and goodness. The modern genetic engineering sees man as a product of evolutionary process, and an agent controlling and directing this process. Humanism as the philosophic attitude regards the interpretation of human experience as the primary concern of all philosophizing and asserts the adequacy of human knowledge for this purpose. By giving to all science and literature a reference to human life and its purpose, philosophy connects itself with literary humanism. Science, viewed in its relation to man, can be utilised for human purpose. But emphasis on utilitarian aspect of science undermines its value as independent branch of human knowledge.  
  

Gandhian Humanism  
Gandhi's great contribution to Humanism consists in conceiving a religion that centres almost wholly around man and his life here in this world. Religion, according to him, should pervade all our activities, it cannot and ought not to be pursued in seclusion from one's fellow beings and in separation from life's other activities. The equivalent for Religion is "Dharma" in Sanskrit which means moral obligation and connotes individual's integrity as well as social Solidarity. Gandhi understood religion completely from that point of view. His Humanism is integral, discussing all the aspects of human life and has rationalist attitudes which differ from Romantic Humanism as well as Radical Humanism and yet synthesizes the two.  
  

Free Will In Gandhian Thought  
The Problem of free will is discussed by almost all renaissance humanists. \`Man the measure’ is the earliest declaration of humanistic outlook. Humanists confirm that man is the maker of his own destiny. Gandhi also gave great importance to freedom. His whole life was spent for the individual's and national freedom. However for him free will did not mean slavery to desires of our mind but freedom of \`rational self'. Once you condition yourself with ‘rational self'’ you are free to move within those restraints. In the words of Emerson, "A man is free to speak the truth not to lie, free to serve, not to exploit, free to sacrifice himself but not free to kill or injure". Gandhi's whole philosophy of wants and needs was conditioned by self-control. Gandhi has respect for and faith in the individual. To him, the individual alone is real; the Society and the state have little meaning apart from the individual. Prof. Iyer regards Gandhi as one of the most revolutionary of individualists and one of the most individualistic of revolutionaries in world history.  
The Importance of Morality in Humanism  
Renaissance Humanist accorded the privileged position to poetry, rhetoric, history, ethics and politics on the conviction that these disciplines alone educate man as such and put man in a position effectively to exercise his freedom. Like other humanists, Gandhi gives importance to Social Sciences. Having an ethical approach to life Gandhi sought to unite the mankind in common pursuit of justice and establishment of a moral order in world-society. Morality for him was not a matter of outward conformity but of inward fulfillment, of deep conviction accomplished by right action. Hence famous Socratic dictum \`Virtue is knowledge', implies that right thought must result into right action. For Gandhi action was his domain. Gandhi's greatness lies in translating one's noblest thoughts into action which is the highest achievement of man.  
Action Oriented Seven Fields of Social Life  
Gandhi wanted people to put into practice morality in the seven main fields of life. He enumerated following seven Social Sins:  

1. Politics without principles.
2. Wealth without work.
3. Commerce without morality.
4. Knowledge without character.
5. Pleasure without conscience.
6. Science without humanity.
7. Worship without sacrifice.

1.   The first epigram deals with the Political field. As Plato says "either true and genuine philosophers find their way to political authority or powerful politicians by the favor of Providence take to true Philosophy'. Philosophers are the men of Principles. For Gandhi Rama was the symbol of a king dedicated to Principles. The Kings in Indian tradition were only the guardian executors and servants of ‘Dharma’. The two main principles which were practiced by Gandhi and advocated for the society are Truth and Non-violence.  
2.   The second and the third dicta deal with the sphere of Economics. Tolstoy and Ruskin inspired Gandhi on the idea of bread-labour. The Bhagavad Gita also declares that he who eats without offering sacrifice eats stolen food. Gandhi put this into practice at his community centers. Bread-labor was one of the vows of his ‘Asrama’ prayer. The word \`Sacrifice’ of the Bhagvad Gita was interpreted in the sense of "yajna" or rituals of Mimamsa system by the earlier ‘Acaryas’ but Gandhi put it into modern context when bread-labour was looked down upon with the spread of Industrialization and class-consciousness. Gandhi quotes Bible, "In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat thy bread". So far as body only needs food, one should labour for it with the help of one's body only. Moderate labour makes one healthy and creative. Gandhi advocated more or less equal wages for all kinds of work. These strains in his thought made him a champion of economic democracy no less than political and moral democracy.  
3.   The third dictum was developed into the idea of Trusteeship by Gandhi. Business man has to act only as a trustee of the Society for whatever he has gained from the Society. Everything finally belongs to the Society. "Trusteeship provides a means of transforming the present capitalist order of society into an egalitarian one".  
4.   The fourth dictum deals with knowledge. Education stands for the all round development of the individual and his character. Gandhi's system of Basic Education was the system for development of one's character. True knowledge leads to the development of one's character where one evolves his \`Rational self'.  
5.   Conscience of a ‘Rational Self’ is evolved with consideration of whole mankind, particularly the poorest of all. Gandhi gave a ‘talisman’ \`Whenever you are in doubt or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test: Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him'. This will lead to the balance of the use of natural resources also.  
6.   About the progress of Science Vinoba Bhave has said "Science should progress in the direction of Spirituality" otherwise it would bring total destruction. Gandhi held that Science without the thought of the welfare of humanity is a Sin. Science and humanity together pave the way for welfare of all.  
7\. . In Religion, we worship, but if we are not ready to sacrifice for Social service, the worship has no value; it is sin to worship without sacrifice. Gandhi's everyday prayer was a recitation of the virtues of an ideal person as depicted in the Bhagvad Gita. His prayer is addressed to one's own better self, the conscience, the true self. Gandhi advocated the concept of Ethical Religion and not dry and dead ritualism. He saw the biggest threat to Religion not from the atheists but from the dogmatists, fundamentalists and ritualists. He considered poverty, inequality, exploitation, oppression, hunger, barriers of caste, class and creed, as man-made and showed a way out of it through an integral Philosophy of life. Gandhi was prepared to repudiate scriptural and canonical texts if these were repugnant to reason and moral values. There is no Religion higher than Truth and Righteousness. Gandhi views life in its integral wholeness. According to him "human life is a synthetic whole which cannot be divided into separate watertight compartments ­ religious, moral, political, economic, social, individual and collective. All the seemingly separate segments are but different facets of man's life. They act and react upon one another". For Gandhi, all life is of one piece'. These seven dicta deal with all the aspects of human life and thus indicate integral humanism of Gandhi. Among the thinkers of Modern India probably nobody has contributed more for the advancement of humanism than Mahatma Gandhi. He gave humanistic basis to Social Philosophy: he humanized Politics, Science and Religion.  
  
The Integrated Vows For Society  
As part of his moral religion, Gandhi introduced eleven vows in his "Asrama" (Community centre). He wrote about these vows to the "Asramites" from Yeravada Jail. They are 1. Non violence, 2. Truth, 3. Non-stealing , 4. Chastity or celibacy, 5. Non possession, 6. Bread labour, 7. Abstemiousness in diet, 8. Fearlessness, 9. Tolerance or Equality for all religions, 10. Self-sufficiency in respect of the use of indigenous products, 11. Elimination of untouchability. All these vows have integral implication of moral, Social, Political and Economic Values. Gandhi attached special importance to these vows, not in a ritualistic manner, but as a way of entering more deeply into the truth.  
Ahimsa (Non-Violence): The Universal Love  
Gandhi described "Ahimsa" to be the law of life; he identified "Ahimsa" with universal love. To him "All well constructed societies are based on the law of Non-Violence that the families are bound together by ties of love and so are groups in the so called civilized society. Only they do not recognize the supremacy of the law of non-violence. Gandhi transformed "Ahimsa" from a passive attitude to an active and dynamic factor by welding renunciation and action into one force. He was therefore able to transform Ahimsa's earlier world-denying expressions into a world-affirming realpolitik and build a bridge principally through action and only afterwards by thought, between its application for social good on the one hand and for individual spiritual development on the other. Even "Satyagraha" is conceived by Gandhi as non-violence in action. Ahimsa being the law of love, it consists not in claiming but in giving. \`Love ever suffers, never resents, never revenges itself', it is self-suffering.’ Gandhi used non-violence not only at the individual level but also on the social level for abolition of untouchability, picketing, and non-cooperation. On the political level he brought about liberation without the use of violence. Einstein believed that the problem of bringing peace to the world on supranational basis will be solved only by employing Gandhi's method on a large scale. Gandhi firmly believed that non-violence must be lived in day to day life. "It is not like a garment to be put on and off at Will. Its seat is in the heart and it must be an inseparable part of our being» it should become a creed rather than a policy; and to be a creed, Non-violence has to be all-pervasive.  
Satya Truth: The Law of Moral Order  
Without non-violence it is not possible to seek and find Truth. Non-violence and truth are so intertwined that it is practically impossible to separate them. They are like two sides of a coin or rather a smooth unstamped metallic disc. It has no observe, or the reverse. Nevertheless, non-violence is the means Truth is the end. Gandhi's truth is akin to Vedic Rta, the moral order and ultimate principle of the Universe» therefore he identities God with truth. "To me God is Truth and Love, God is ethics and morality, God is Humility, and truthfulness." Gandhi was conscious of what truth is and followed a path of humanism. For Gandhi, truth is not only truthfulness in word, but also in thought and deed» not only the relative truth of our conception but the absolute truth, the Eternal principle, that is God. Thus Existential meaning of God is Truth. Gandhi's truth meant freedom of self-actualization for societal development º Gandhi's mystic fight against three foremost social institutions-imperialism, capitalism and racism ­ is an invincible proof that his conception of truth was very much societal. Gandhi's all other vows follow from Truth and Non-violence as Socratic virtue followed from knowledge. Gandhi wanted the application of these principles for the smooth functioning of all the organizations striving to bring about social transformation. Gandhi's aim was to evolve a moral man in a moral society.  
Sarva-Dharma Samanata: Tolerance or Equality For All Religions  
This vow embodies in itself the true spirit of harmony among different Religions of the world. Gandhi as a humanist has provided us the lasting solution to the vexed problem of so-called secularism. Humanism did not have an anti-religious or anti-Christian character. The religious discussions of the humanist had two principal themes the Civic function of religion and religious tolerance. The Civic function of religion was recognised on the basis of the correspondence between the heavenly and earthly city. The heavenly city was the norm or the ideal of man's civil life, its recognition meant the commitment of man to realize, as much as possible, its characteristics in the earthly city. Gandhi's earthly city was ‘Ramarajya’ and he tried to realize that throughout his life. For the humanists, the attitude of tolerance is derived from their conviction of the fundamental unity of all the religious beliefs of mankind and therefore the possibility of a universal religious peace. The vow of tolerance of all religious beliefs in Gandhi's everyday Prayer, and the cooperation he received from the people of all faiths, confirm his genuine tolerance. Gandhi's religion was not narrow sectarian. He did not want his house to be walled in on all sides and windows to be stuffed. He wanted the cultures of all lands to be blown about his house as freely as possible.  
Conclusion  
As a humanist, Gandhi worshipped God through the service of man and looked upon all human beings as but the manifestations of God Himself. His humanism meant his utter devotion to the human interest. "The nineteenth Century was marked by Industrial Revolution, the twentieth century was a century of nuclear holocaust and environmental degradation, the Twenty-first should bring a synthesis of Science and spirituality, Socialism with human rights, Social change with non-violence national sovereignty with world citizenship. And this is Gandhi".

**Lecture 4**

  

John Locke - There are certain fundamental individual rights that no representative government can override them. Those fundamental rights include a natural life to life, liberty and property. 

  

Right to property is a natural right. It is pre political. It is present even before government comes on the scene and laws are enacted. 

  

State of nature is a state of liberty. Human beings are free and equal beings. There is no natural hierarchy. Even in a state of nature there is a law.

  

The rights we have, we can't give up. Nor we can take them from somebody's else. We are not free to take our own life. We are the creature of God and God has prior property rights. The idea of reason. We will be led to the conclusion that freedom does not mean freedom to do whatever we want.

  

Our natural rights are unalienable.

Everyone can enforce the law of nature. If someone violates the law of nature he should be punished.

  

It starts out looking very benign but it gets into trouble. The only way to escape from state of nature is to undertake the act of assent. To create a govt or community where there will be a legislature to make law and everybody agrees to obey laws decided by majority.

**Lecture 6**

  

The Critique of Pure Reason - Immanuel Kant

Supreme principle of morality. What freedom really is. 

Kant rejects utilitarianism. All human beings have certain dignity that commands our respect. We are all rational beings. We are capable of reason and we are also autonomous beings and can act and choose freely. 

Utilitarians were half right. We seek to avoid pain and like pleasure. 

Pain and pleasure are not our sovereign masters. It's our rational capacity that distinguishes us from animals. 

  

To act freely = To act autonomously. 

  

Opposite of autonomy = Heteronomy. Acting according to an inclination. 

Nature is governed by laws of cause and effect. 

  

To act freely is not to choose something for best end but to choose the best end itself.

We act as means to realisation to ends. We are instruments rather than author in pursuit of our goals.

Capacity to act freely gives human life its dignity. Human beings an end itself. Therefore it is wrong to use people for fulfilment of goals.

  

Motive for duty vs inclination

  

Reverence for the moral laws.

  

Capacity for reason exists undifferentiated among all of us. It is a universal capacity. So there is a fixed moral law it is fine to have sentiment or feeling but that does not form basis of duty

  

A good will isn't good because of what it effects or accomplishes, it's good in itself. Even if by utmost effort the good will accomplishes nothing it would shine like a jewel for its own shake as somethign which has its full value in itself.

  

Moral worth of an action depends on motive (do the right thing for the right reason).

  

Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time, as an end.

  

**The concept of humanity as an end.**

  

**Act only on that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.**

  

Honesty is the best policy - It's also the most profitable.
