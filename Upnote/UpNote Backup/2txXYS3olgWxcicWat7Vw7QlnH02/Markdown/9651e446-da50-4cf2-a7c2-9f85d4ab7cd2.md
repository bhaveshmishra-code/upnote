# Pathway to Service Delivery

It is the science of constantly refining public systems through better design of systems and service delivery mechanisms; understanding administrative behaviour and applying it to making design more robust and to improve public performance.

  

According to Appelbaum performance is a function of : Ability, Motivation and Opportunity (AMO theory)

  

Public Servants

- Knights (public spirited)
- Knaves (self interested)

Citizens

- Pawns (passive recipients)
- Queens (empowered users of choice)

  

**Principal Agent Model**

Principal = Employer; Agent = Employee

Govt employee as self interested, opportunistic agents who feather their own nest at the expense of public interest.

  

Employees can be made to function efficiently by:

- monitoring performance
- strong incentives to do their job right

**4 Main Models of Delivery**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Trust & Altruism<br><br>Public service ethics as bedrock of govt performance.<br><br>  <br><br>Professionals like it, high morale, no monitoring cost, trust a desirable feature<br><br>  <br><br>Assumes providers are knights (what if they are knaves). Knights rarely efficient - doing good is enough | Hierarchy and Targets (Mistrust)<br><br>Ex-ante targets and rigorous reporting mechanism - target and terror regimes.<br><br>  <br><br>Sets targets, monitors performance, naming & shaming through star ratings, successful in short run as provides sticks and carrots<br><br>  <br><br>Top down, needs robust system of measurement, terror not a good way to motivate people, drive out intrinsic knightly attributes - professional de-motivation |
| Voice<br><br>Empowerment of people. Consultative meetings, petitions, complaint procedures.<br><br>  <br><br>Gives information to provider about nature of service, relies upon personal interaction - essential element of public service<br><br>  <br><br>Users may have poor information, may not be equally representative - favours the articulate middle class, needs favourable response from providers which is mostly hostile | Choice & Competition<br><br>Provide choice among providers. Foster competition among providers and impact performance.<br><br>  <br><br>Strong incentives to promote responsiveness to users needs and wants. Appeals to both knights and knaves.<br><br>  <br><br>Poor user information - needs provider of information. Negative impact on knightly motivation. |
