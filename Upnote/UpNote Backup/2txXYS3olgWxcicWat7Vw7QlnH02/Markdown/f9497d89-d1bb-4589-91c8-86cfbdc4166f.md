# The One Thing

If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one

  

Be like a postage stamp, stick to one thing till you get there.

  

_What's the ONE thing that you can do this week such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary ?_

Extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus.

  

You need to be doing fewer things for more effect instead of doing more things with side effects.

  

# Big Ideas

- Go small - Don't focus on being busy; focus on being productive. Allow what matters most to drive your day.
- Go extreme
- Say NO

  

**Multitasking is a lie**
