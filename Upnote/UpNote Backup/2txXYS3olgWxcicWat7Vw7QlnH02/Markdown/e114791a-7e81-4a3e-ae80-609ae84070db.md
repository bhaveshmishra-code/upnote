# 11 January

It was again a free day for us. Carrying luggage is the most frustrating aspect of the Bharat Darshan therefore we decided to courier our excess stuff especially winter clothings to Delhi.

  

We spent our day eating out, watching TV and relaxing. In the evening Kuhuk invited us for a dinner at her house. She lives in Jaipur and her parents are IAS officers of the Rajasthan Cadre. It was a great experience interacting with her parents. They shared their experiences at LBSNAA and also gave some words of wisdom. For example, once you become District Collector you have to pretend that you know everything however the reality is that you hardly know nothing for in states like Rajasthan and Bihar one becomes DM within 4 years which is too less a time to gain experience in all departments.

  

After a delicious dinner we headed back to Circuit house to pack our bags and prepare for an early morning journey to Ajmer.
