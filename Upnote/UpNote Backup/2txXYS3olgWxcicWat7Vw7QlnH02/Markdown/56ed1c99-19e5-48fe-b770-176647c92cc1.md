# Power of Now

[http://tinybuddha.com/](http://tinybuddha.com/)

As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease. When you act out the present-moment awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, and loveâ€”even the most simple action." ~Eckhart Tolle
