There was a very intelligent and educated man who worked for the king. The king's ministers were very jealous of him and wanted to set a trap for him to prove that he isn't that smart.   
They sat down and made a plan: tomorrow, they will ask him if he knows everything. When he says he does, they'll ask him to tell them what they are thinking, and agreed to say the opposite, since nobody can't prove that,  and make a fool out of him in front of the king.  
  
The day came and they asked the man: "Do you know everything?".  
The man said exactly what they expected. So they move on to ask him what their thoughts are. The man says:

"You are all thinking how much you respect and admire the king."
