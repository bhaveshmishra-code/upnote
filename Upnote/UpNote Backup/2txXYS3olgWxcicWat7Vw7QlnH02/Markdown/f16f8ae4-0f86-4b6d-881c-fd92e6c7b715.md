We had no attachment today.

Went to Kaladungri first. It's a rocky place from top of which a majestic view of Rann is seen. After spending few hours we headed for the white desert. We also crossed Tropic of Cancer in between.

  

We reached Rann of Katch in the afternoon. We were very hungry and therefore had some snacks. The cost and the quality of the snacks were quite good. Gujarati shopkeepers are very friendly and cordia. The famous Rann Mahotsav was also going on and we saw colorful sets and tents everywhere.

  

We had to walk around 2 km to reach the white desert. It was an amazing experience and we just marvelled at the geographical diversity of India where just few days back we were in Kashmir at freezing temperature. It was white salt everywhere and we clicked truckloads of photos. Rann has a great tourism potential and it was good to see that Gujarat tourism department has encashed on it.

  

It was time to say goodbye to amazing Kutch as we boarded the train from Bhuj for Surat.
