Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson went on a camping trip. After a good meal, they lay down for the night and went to sleep. Some hours later, Holmes awoke and  nudged his faithful friend. Holmes said: "Watson, look up and tell me what you see".   
Watson said: "I see a fantastic panorama of countless stars."  
Holmes: "And what does that tell you?"  
Watson pondered for a moment: "Astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo. Horologic-ally, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three. Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful and that we are small and insignificant. Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow."  
"Why? - What does it tell you, Holmes?"

Holmes was silent for a moment then spoke: "My good Watson... someone has stolen our tent."
