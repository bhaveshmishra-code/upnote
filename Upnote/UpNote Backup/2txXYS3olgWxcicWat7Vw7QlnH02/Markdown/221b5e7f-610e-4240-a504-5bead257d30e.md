## Khata Merging

- Just because the Aadhar number of both Khatas are same doesnâ€™t mean that we should accept the applications by default.
- Verification of pahani records, how did the applicant acquire the land etc. should be enquired in detail.
- Only if the applicant is eligible for Digital Signature for all the Survey Numbers, the application should be approved.

  

## POB

- In many survey numbers the reason for blocking is mentioned as **court case study.**Â 
- Many MROs are asking the petitioner to bring the court order passed in the favour of the petitioner for unblocking the land.
- Survey numbers are blocked through **Court Intimation Module.** Earlier blocked survey numbers can be checked.Â 

  

## Pending MutationÂ 

- It's important to check âœ… whether the applicant is in the possession of the land e.g. In Survey Number 291 of Jaggaihapeta the applicants were not in possession of the land despite having registered document.Â 
- In many cases the registration has been done by producing false documents ðŸ“„ or without the proper knowledge of the seller e.g. In Mogullapally Mandal, a father sold away 7 Acres land to his daughter. After few months the father has lodged a complaint that he wanted to sell only 7 Guntas of land and not the entire extent.

  

## Rejection

- Frivolous rejections just to reduce the pendency should be strictly avoided.Â 
- Financial penalty along with disciplinary action would be intiatiatrd in such cases.

  

## Issuing EndorsementÂ 

- MROs should develop a habit of issuing endorsement as per the rules and not to make the petitioner run around MRO / Collector Office.Â 
- MRO are instructed not to intervene in civil matters. These are best left to the jurisdiction of the civil court.
- MROs to be **alert** regarding - government & assigned land. Notices and resumption / eviction orders should be issued promptly without delay.
