Once frogs decided to have a competition to climb on a pole. The frog who would reach the highest point would be awarded. Frogs gathered from all over on the day of the competition. As climbing was a very difficult thing for frogs there were only few participants. Most of the frogs were there just as spectators and most of them thought it was an impossible thing to do.  
  
Competition started. Frogs started to try climbing the pole one by one. When they were trying they kept slipping and falling off all the time. Spectators made fun of them and ridiculed them. Almost all the participants gave up after few tries not withstanding the ridicule.  
  
One of the frogs kept trying, he just didn't give up. He fell off many times but he kept trying even though everyone around was making fun of him.And after long time finally reached the top of the pole. He was awarded with much appreciation from his fellow frogs.Â   
  

The frog presenting the award asked the winning frog, what was the secret of his persistence. He didn't respond. He was asked again. Winning frog still didn't respond. Some other frog who knew this winning frog came forward and said "He is deaf".
