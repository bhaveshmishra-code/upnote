## **Supreme Court Judgment**

The Act says the reasons for rejecting the claims need to be communicated in writing to the claimant, following which the claimant can appeal against it in the sub-divisional level committee within 60 days.

  

Asked the state governments to explain why the claims were rejected and whether all the evidence was examined before rejecting them.

## **How to Plan Survey**

4. Mandal wise availability of device.
