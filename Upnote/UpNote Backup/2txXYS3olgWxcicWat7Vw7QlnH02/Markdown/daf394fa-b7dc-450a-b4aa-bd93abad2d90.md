2. If you enjoy doing mathematics.

**Busting Myths**

  

There are several myths surrounding science optionals. Prominent among them are:

1. It's very difficult to clear with science subjects as the syllabus is huge.
2. Only students from IITs can clear.
3. There is heavy normalization so unless you attempt 100% of the paper you will not get marks.

Now these concerns are baseless.Â
