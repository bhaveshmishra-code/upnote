The first divorce directly related to the September 11th terrorist attacks was filed in a NY court.   
  
It appears a guy with an office on the 103rd floor of the World Trade Center left home for work on Sept 11. When he got to Manhattan, he decided to spend the morning at his girlfriend's apartment in the Village. When he got to her place, he turned off the phones, TV and radio and spent the entire morning in bed with her. At about 11:00 am, while still at her place, he turned his cell phone back on to retrieve his messages.   
  
A second later it rang. His wife was on the phone crying and screaming at him, "I've been trying to call you for over two hours!! I've been worried sick about you! Are you OK?!?" He answered calmly that he was fine.   
  
The wife then asked, "Where are you?"   
  

The guy said, "Where do you think I am? I'm in my office!"
