College years are the best time to explore and experience new things and therefore it is always advisable to grab whatever opportunities comes in your way.

  

The idea of preparing for UPSC while ignoring your internship is not advisable as you will miss out on many things. Many of my friends who were earlier inclined towards civil services ultimately opted for research / tech industry after having exposed to the private sector. Moreover, you can prepare alongside your internship as your weekends will be free.

  

Most companies do give pre placement offer which comes in very handy in your final year when you are spared the anxiety of placement and you can concentrate on your UPSC preparation.

  

Moreover, there is no harm in actually working for an year or two before giving your first attempt. It ensures financial security and rescues you in case of failure in exam. The situation where you have neither cleared the exam and nor had any job experience is indeed scary and I have many friends undergoing through such trauma.

  

While developing software we take care of even those situations which have 1 in a million chance of occurence. This is based on the dictum: **Prepare for the worst, hope for the best.** Therefore, given the uncertain and unpredictable nature of UPSC it is best to first secure yourself and then march confidently towards your goal.
