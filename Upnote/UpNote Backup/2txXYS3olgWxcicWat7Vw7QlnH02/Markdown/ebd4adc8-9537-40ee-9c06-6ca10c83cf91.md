Once a old lady stepped into a bus with her son and when bus started to move, his son stepped out and asked her to mind stop X.   
After two minutes of ride, old lady walked up aisle and asked conductor if stop X has come.   
Conductor said not yet.  
After that she started doing it every now and then. So the conductor got pissed off and shouted"You old lady , go back and sit at your place.I ll inform you when we reach there."  
So lady sat at her seat for about two hours and then went back to him for same question.This time conductor said "mam we are really sorry, stop x passed 1 hour ago.but we will go back there for you "  
So the bus ran for one hour in opposite direction. On reaching at X, conductor told her "here is your stop X mam".

Old lady took a pill from her bag , swallowed it and told conductor to move ahead " my son told me to take them when we reach at place X"
