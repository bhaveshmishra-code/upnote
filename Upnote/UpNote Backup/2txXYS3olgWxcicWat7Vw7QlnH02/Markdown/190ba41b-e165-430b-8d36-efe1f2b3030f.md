# 05 January

It was our last day in Srinagar. We settled our bills and headed for the airport. There was a heavy security check at the airport. We boarded the Air India flight for Delhi. It was an amazing 10 days in the valleys and I will remain grateful for the army for their hospitality. Seldom do we realize the difficult and life threatening situations in which our Army jawans work. We reached Delhi in the afternoon.

We had no attachments that day. Being a Delhiite, I got an opportunity to go to home. After spending 3 months in the pristine environment of Mussorie I could clearly notice the high levels of air pollution in the city. It was actually suffocating. Moreover, due to El Nino effect the temperatures were 7 - 8 degrees higher than the normal temperatures and it was unusually warm. I got to witness the odd even scheme of the government in operation. The feedback was positive and there were less vechicles on the road.

I reached home and it was great meeting my parents after so many days.
