One morning at a doctor's surgery a patient arrives complaining of  
serious back-pain. The doctor examines him and asks him" OK, what  
Happened to your back?"  
   
The patient replies "You know that I work for a local night club? This  
Morning I got home to my apartment early and heard a noise in my  
bedroom. On entering I knew someone had been with my wife and the  
Balcony door was open. I rushed out the balcony door and did not find  
anyone. As I looked down from the balcony I saw a man running out and he  
was dressing himself. I grabbed the fridge and threw it at him, that's  
How I strained my back"  
   
The 2nd patient arrives looking as if he has been in a car wreck. The  
Doctor said "My previous patient looked bad, but you look terrible. What  
The hell happened to you?"  
   
He replied, "You know I have been unemployed for a while now .Today was  
The first day at my new job. I forgot to set my alarm and was running  
late. I was running out of the building, getting dressed at the same  
time, and you won't believe it but I was hit by a fridge."  
   
The 3rd patient arrives; he looks even worse than the other two patients  
do. The doctor is shocked. Again asks, "What the hell happened to  
you.....?"  
 

"Well I was sitting in a fridge & someone threw it from the 3rd floor"
