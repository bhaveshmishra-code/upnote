Dear Babu

  

We reached Patna at 5:30 in the morning. The train was right on time. It's amazing how time flies by. It seems only yesterday when we had left Patna in the month of May. 5 months have passed so quickly. 

  

As usual the Patna junction railway station was bustling with crowd. We took a cab. The amount of luggage was quite huge. The circuit house is situated just 2 kms away from the station. 

  

Anshul Agarwal, the probationer, had booked a room for me in the circuit house. As soon as we reached the Circuit House we saw a poisonous snake just near our door. No efforts were made by us or the Circuit House staff to chase it or cause any harm. 

  

6 of us sat in a room and the usual chit chat began. Due to the upcoming PM visit, we were asked to vacate the rooms the next day. We had no place to stay.
