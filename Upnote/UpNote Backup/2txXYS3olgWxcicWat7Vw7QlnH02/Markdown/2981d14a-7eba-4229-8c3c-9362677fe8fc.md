A boy was cycling with a basket of eggs on it. He hit a stone and fell down along with the cycle.  
  
. . . The eggs also fell down and broke. A crowd gathered around the boy.  
  
. . . As usual free advice started flowing from the on lookers   “Couldn’t you be more careful?”  “What is this, you are cycling ,  casually without attention?”   
  
. . . An old man approached the crowd , saw what had happened and  said  “Poor fellow this boy has to answer the Owner of the shop . Ok I  will help him , as much as I can”  
  
...... saying this handed over Rs10/- to the boy. And also said  “These onlookers are good people, they will not only give advice, they  will help you by giving money also, accept their help”  
  
.  . . The onlookers observing the sayings of the old man and his actions , gave money to the boy  
  
.  . . The boy was very  happy, since the money collected was more than the value of the eggs broken  
  
. . . One of the onlooker  asked the boy “young man if that old man  was not around , I do not know what difficulties you would have faced  with your owner”   
  
  
  
  
  
  
. . . The boy smiled and replied “Sir ,that old man is the owner of the shop , where I work”  
  
  
  

. . **Clever owner :) :)**
