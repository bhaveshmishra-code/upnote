# Untitled Note

Dear Ila

  

I have not been able to talk to you for last 2 days. I can't describe the level of my earnestness and longing to meet you.

  

There has not been an hour in which I don't think about you. I must have seen your picture where you don't want to go to early to the railway station atleast more than 100 times.

  

In my free time I go through your videos (some of them secretly captured) and pics. I love to relive those moments.

  

Your cute face and adorable features are priceless !

  

I get so excited when I think about our next meeting at the airport. I visualise you resting your head on my hands and me saying - "aap chhota Babu ho na!"

  

Can't wait to meet you. Take care
