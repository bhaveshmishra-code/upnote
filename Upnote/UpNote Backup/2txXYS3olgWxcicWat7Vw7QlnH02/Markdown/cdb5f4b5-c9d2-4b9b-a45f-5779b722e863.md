A man and a woman who never met before, find themselves on upper and lower berth of a long distance train.  
  
At 2 am, man leans over saying, "Ma'am, sorry to bother you, would you be kind enough to give me a second blanket from the side table. It's awfully cold here.  
  
"I have a better idea", she replied, "Just for tonight, why don't we pretend that we are married?"  
  
"Great idea Ma'am", he replied in great excitement.  
  

She says, "Well then get up and take it yourself".
